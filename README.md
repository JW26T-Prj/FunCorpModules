# Welcome to the Jessiewind26's Funcorp Modules folder.

This folder contain all the scripts made by the old Spectra Advanced Module Group folder and the codes that players sent to the folder administrators.
These codes are intended to be used with FunCorp members, but other players will not have problems using the codes.

To add a code to this folder, please contact JesseGleenOld#7074 or Akwimos#5407 into Discord.
Into Transformice, contact Jessiewind26#2546, Dhanny_mheyran#6701 or Akwimos#1937.

If you want to request a code remove or report a bug or issue, contact we using the above nicknames or create an issue into GitHub.
